           <h2>Her story</h2>
           <p>A long time ago there was an island far from here that was so beautiful. It had the most beautiful flowers you will never see any where and animals. It was full of nature. But there was a place where no one would dare to go. The place is called the jungle of death. It’s a dark spooky Jungle. And if you go in you’ll never come out go out unless you are the bravest of them all. The jungle of Death wasn’t like this until no one would come back to the magical place. Now it was too late to bring the Joy back to the Jungle so the Jungle was left and no one ever again went in there. <p>
             
    But one time there was a girl who risked her life to discover the jungle and lived to tell the tale. Her name was Molly. Molly was just a little girl. She was a young girl who discovered many beautiful things and no one has ever seen how her adventure started.

    <p>
    As Molly was running away from home she picked up the old map of the Jungle in the library. Then she reached the Jungle. She looked back and waved goodbye to the nice village. While she was brave on the outside, she was terrified inside. But she was a brave young girl she kept on going no matter what. While she was looking at the map, she saw a giant nest on the map. Then she looked up there was a giant nest and there was a giant eggs in it. She looked up the sky and she saw a giant bird trying to attack her. She climbed the nest and when she got on the top, the eggs started to hatch. The first one came out trying to eat her but something weird happened. The mother bird picked Molly up with the beak and drooped her on the other side of the nest. Then the mother bird bowed her head while Molly was running to the waterfall she saw on the map. Time passed by and she made it to the waterfall. She smelt horrible so she took a bath. Then she fell when while she was putting her clothes on and landed on her feet like she knew what was happening. Then she zipped up her zip and looked up she saw a bright light in the distance. She ran then she fell on the ground. The next thing you know there was rocks falling from the sky. She ran to safety then she made it back. She thought about it and she thought it’s not that horrible. In fact she had fun. Then she saw a sign that said LOST and there was a picture of her. She quickly ran home. When she opened the door, her mother hugged her and busted into tears. Molly never told anyone about this until now.</p>
